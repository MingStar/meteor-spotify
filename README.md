Meteor Spotify DJ
===

Create a webserver that allows people to enqueue tracks to be played in Spotify.

This is OSX only, since `spotify-node-applescript` uses applescript to talk to Spotify.

Getting started
---

Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Open Spotify.

Run in project directory:

```sh
meteor
open http://localhost:3000
```
